name: Design interactive deliverables
area: Design Documentation
description: Design interactive deliverables are prototypes created to validate features with users before investing development effort. Producing and testing a high-fidelity prototype will demand effort from the product team and the client, therefore it is a technique used to test a feature that a) is crucial to the product; b) has a high development cost, or c) brings a disruptive change to a key behavior. A product team should list and document the created prototypes in the team’s central repository.
