area: Agile
description: Product development is a team work, and for that, it is crucial that team members communicate well with each other. Teams with good communication interact well in a range of verbal or written contexts. This includes face-to-face meetings (in person or remotely), chats on Slack channels, Confluence docs, Asana or Jira tickets, and also pull requests and design specs.

# How do you evaluate your team’s communication with each other?

[ ] (Weak) Communication is an issue for our team. Messages are often confusing and team members don’t have a schedule to communicate.
[ ] (Low) Communication needs improving. Messages often lack context and team members only report progress or blockers weekly.   
[ ] (Intermediary) Communication needs improving. Team members report progress or blockers daily, but lack context.   
[ ] (High) Communication is good. Messages have context and team members report progress or blockers daily.
[ ] (Elite) Communication is fluent. Messages have context and team members report progress or blockers daily. Our team is objective, but empathic. Learnings are highlighted and shared.
